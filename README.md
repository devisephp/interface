# Devise Interface

## What is Devise?

Devise is a content management solution that allows developers use a combination of VueJS and Laravel Blade documents to create page "slices" that are just parts of what make up a webpage. Those slices can then be implemented in any order and configuration by content managers throughout their site without the need for a developer. This allows developers to work with their clients and designers in a very iterative way to grow their site incrementally, add new features with ease, and test different page layouts to find the one that is most successful.
